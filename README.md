A service for ranking and tagging posts on social networks

## Download data
```console
wget -i scripts/datalinks.txt -P data/pikabu
```

## Download, process source data and lemmatize it (Now avalilable on Linux ubuntu platform only)
```console
make data_source && make lemmatize
```

## Train pytorch modesls
This project uses lightning for code structuring and hydra for flexible experiment configuring and tracking.
All models can be implemented in uniform structure. Models should be implemented in src/models/components. 
Training settings must be implemented in src/models. All data processing functional should be implemented in
src/data/components and lightning data modules must be implemented at src/data. All model configurations is set
in configs folder. You can configure model in .yaml files or set parameters in terminal:
```console
python src/train.py "hydra parameters overrides"
```
## Train pytorch models. Example
```console
python src/train.py \
    experiment=rate_prediction \
    model.net.hidden_dim=256 \
    model.optimizer.lr=1e-5
```
# Main results

## Rating prediction

We provide main results in table below. Best models is based on ruBERT embeddings. We provide links to source files to reproduce our results. More detailed information is available in docs/paper.pdf

1. BTTFW = finetuned BTTFW = **B**ERT with **T**itle prepending to the text markdown with **F**reezed weights after first two epochs with **W**ilson scrore targets.
2. CBTTW = CatBoost trained on finetuned bert embedding with **W**ilson scrore targets.
3. BTFW = finetuned **B**ERT with text markdown only and **F**reezed weights after first two epochs with **W**ilson scrore targets.
4. BW = end-to-end trained feed-forward regression network with freezed pretraied **B**ERT backbone with **W**ilson scrore targets.
5. BR = end-to-end trained feed-forward regression network with freezed pretraied **B**ERT backbone with stantartized pluses and minuses.
